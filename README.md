# Hello, my name is Travis Southard!
## I am a full stack software engineer!

### About me
My name is Travis, and I am a software engineer living in Philadelphia with my spouse, Ruby, and our two cats, Topaz and Basil. I am interested in gardening, bike touring, and solarpunk living.

**I am currently looking for full time work as a software engineer**, especially working with civic technology or geospatial solutions. I have previously worked at Comcast via Brooksource, Element84, Azavea, and Urality.

I am actively volunteering with Code for Philly on the leadership team. Previous roles for Code for Philly have been as the tech lead for the [Expungement Petition Generator](https://codeforphilly.org/projects/philadelphia_lawyers_for_social_equity_-_record_expungement) benefitting Philadelphia Lawyers for Social Equity and helping to launch the [third places finder](https://codeforphilly.org/projects/third_places_project-launchpad_2023) as part of Code for Philly's Launchpad 2023.

Before transitioning into working in tech, I spent about 5 years working in the bicycle industry as a mechanic and bike tour organizer. I am also an Americorps alum who served in City Year Philadelphia. I have ridden two cross-country bike tours with Bike & Build, and another on the full East Coast Greenway with my best friend.
