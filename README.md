### Hello, my name is Travis and I am a full stack software developer!

I have spent the last few years working in bike shops, leading bike tours, and producing freelance video projects. In summer 2020, I took General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive to help make a career change into the coding world. I am particularly interested in building useful applications that improve people's quality of life and connect people to resources.

> **I am currently seeking junior level software engineer opportunities, especially with a values-based company that has some capacity for mentoring.**
