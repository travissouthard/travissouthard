# Hello, my name is Travis Southard!
## I am a full stack software engineer!

### About me
My name is Travis, and I am a software engineer living in Philadelphia with my spouse, Ruby, and our two cats, Topaz and Basil. I am interested in gardening, bike touring, and solarpunk living.

I am currently working as a software engineer on the Civic Applications team at Element 84, and volunteering with Code for Philly as the tech lead for the Expungement Petition Generator for Philadelphia Lawyers for Social Equity.

Before transitioning into working in tech, I spent about 5 years working in the bicycle industry as a mechanic and bike tour organizer. I am also an Americorps alum who served in City Year Philadelphia. I have ridden two cross-country bike tours with Bike & Build, and another on the full East Coast Greenway with my best friend.
